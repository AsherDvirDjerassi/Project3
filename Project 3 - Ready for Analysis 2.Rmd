# 2016 Primary Election Results

This project uses a data set that contains demographic data on US counties related to the 2016 US Primary Presidential Election.

The dataset contains several main files. The data was retrieved from the url: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election.

## Executive Summary

### Group Members: 
Bianca Sosnovski, Elina Azrilyan, Robert Mercier, Asher Dvir-Djerassi and Charls Joseph.

### Files: 
1) “Primary_Results2016”: Results of the Democratic and Republican primaries, by US County and each presidential candidate; 2) “County_Facts”: The demographic breakdown of the US Counties that voted in the primaries; and 3) “Headers”: Labels of the columns in the county_facts spreadsheet.

### Data Source:
From the data science community Kaggle. URL: https://kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election. 

### Project Description: 
Check for the differences between the counties that voted for the top presidential candidates 

### Project Summary: 
#### Primary Question: 
“Which are the most valued data science skills?”
#### Secondary Question: 
“What are the key elements that explain primary election results of a candidate by state?”  
 
### Team Tools: 
R – for Analysis; Tableau – for some visualizations; Skype – for group meetings; Doodle – for synchronizing meetup times; GitHub for coding and making changes; plain old email.

### Loading process: 
The two datasets we worked with were downloaded as CSV files.  We read the individual files as data frame in R using the function "read.csv".

### Transforming process: 
Since the original datasets were separated, the files had to be merged.  The most efficient way of merging them was using the unique identifier, FIPS code, in each of the two main files. 

### Key Data Challenges: 
1)	While we wanted to view the results for all 50 states, one state did not have primary results.  Minnesota has counties profile results but not primary results, therefore it was not included.  
2)	However, the most significant challenge was getting matches for all the counties in the Primary Results and the County facts files, by no fault of our own.  The FIPS code was the unique identifier needed.  However, since the FIPS code is classified strictly on an individual county basis, some of the polling data did not match.  While the county demographics file based on individual county info had the correct 4-digit and 5-digit codes (4-digits codes did not have a ‘leading’ zero), 11 states broke out the primary results into city, town or district results.  These results manifested themselves into 8-digit codes that where not associated with FIPS.  This was also the reason for the fourth dataset the ANSI county codes for subdivisions.  This said as an example, Illinois has 102 counties, however Cook county is divided into Chicago and the outlying suburbs for a total of 103.  Instead of inferring too much and trying to decode the multitude of rules for each state we simply struck out any state without all the matches.  There were ten (10) states total and one other state (New Hampshire) which was missing the FIPS codes entirely.     

### Thoughts on Data Challenges: 
1)	One thing that became clear is that your final data frame can only be as good as the individual parts.  While we obtained a trove of useful data in the two sets and having the FIPS code helped greatly, if say the FIPS codes are missing in an entire state, as in the case in New Hampshire there is nothing we can do.  The choice comes down to looking up the information manually which 1) defeats the purpose of using an organized dataset 2) is inefficient 3) could lead to mistakes on our end.  
2)	Having a standardized way of receiving or reordering the primary data would have been helpful. While most of the results were reported by county, the ten states that reported differently affected the merging of the data and therefore the final data frame.  Though there was enough data that these omissions wouldn’t systematically affect the results, it is interesting to note of the twelve states: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wyoming that were omitted all six (6) New England states are on the list.  The other states are concentrated in the Midwest to West and Alaska.  
3)	Using the County_Fact dataset as the primary table could have alleviated some of the issues, but also could have caused a lot more headaches.  As mentioned, since the FIPS code was used as the primary identifier and the FIPS is based off the individual counties this dataset might have been the better table to base everything else from.  However, whatever data set you use to relate to the table having that data being reported by county (and therefore FIPS) would be paramount.   Instead of the example of Kansas where the data received was from congressional district rather than county, the data would have to be reported in similar fashion.  

### Recommendations for Future Analysis: 
#### As a next level analysis from the current data it would be interesting to:
1)	Add other candidates to the mix, especially on the Republican side, since there were more.  
2)	Cluster the counties into similar types and analyze those clusters’ propensity to vote on each of the candidates
#### Or with additional data it would be interesting to:
1)	 Compare the primary results to the general election results.  

### Conclusion: 
The primary question we were asked to answer is “Which are the most valued data science skills?”  Although we had our own ideas of the most valued data science skills before the assignment, it was important for us to go through the entire process to make sure we didn’t have any pre-conceived notions. While there were other vital skills that were required, the most valuable data skill, not because it was the “hardest” but because it was the most unpredictable, is data wrangling.  It is exactly the unpredictability of working with large datasets that makes wrangling so valuable.  In huge data sets it is often unpredictable how the data will be organized throughout. Every issue must be dealt with to be able to get the fun part: analysis of the data. The secondary question, “What are the key elements that explain which candidate wins?”, is integrated in the code that follows.  

## Load packages 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)# manipulate table styles
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

## 2016 primary election results data

### Read the data
```{r message=FALSE}
pr_df <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsosnovski/Project3/master/Primary_Results2016.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
kable(head(pr_df))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))
kable(tail(pr_df))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))
dim(pr_df)
```

### Tidying the data 

Spreading the data set to move candidate votes and fraction data from rows to columns. 

```{r}
#The code was adapted from the following help page: https://community.rstudio.com/t/spread-with-multiple-value-columns/5378
pr_df$party <- NULL
pr_df_wide <- pr_df %>%
    gather(variable, value, -(state:candidate)) %>%
    unite(temp, candidate, variable) %>%
    spread(temp, value)
kable(head(pr_df_wide))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))
dim(pr_df_wide)
```

### Create data frame

Now let's create a new data frame with only the data for the 4 candidates we are intersted in: Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump. 

```{r}
new_pr_df <- data.frame(pr_df_wide$state, pr_df_wide$state_abbreviation, pr_df_wide$county, pr_df_wide$fips, pr_df_wide$`Bernie Sanders_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Bernie Sanders_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Hillary Clinton_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Hillary Clinton_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Donald Trump_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Donald Trump_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Ted Cruz_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Ted Cruz_votes`)
names(new_pr_df) <- c("state", "state_abbr", "county", "fips", "sanders fraction votes", "sanders votes", "clinton fraction votes", "clinton votes","trump fraction votes", "trump votes", "cruz fraction votes", "cruz votes")
kable(head(new_pr_df))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))
dim(new_pr_df)

write.csv(new_pr_df,'new_pr_df.csv')
```

## Demographic data

### Read the data
```{r}
facts <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsosnovski/Project3/master/County_Facts.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
glimpse(facts, width = getOption("width"))

headers <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsosnovski/Project3/master/Headers.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = F)
glimpse(headers, width = getOption("width"))
```

### Tidying the data

The data set contains rows with total figures for each state and for the country. Because we can use the summary function to obtains these figures, and also to facilitate the data reading, we filter these rows out. To do so, we note that such rows have the variable state_abbreviation with blanks.

```{r}
facts <- facts %>% filter(state_abbreviation!="")
kable(head(facts))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))
```

### Adjust table headers

The file Headers.csv contains the descriptions of what some of the variables are. We replace the codes in the table headers with those decriptions accordingly.

```{r}
# Function that matches the code in the dataframe column
# and replace it with dictionary value
new.headers <- function(headers,facts){
        n <- nrow(headers)
        for (i in seq(n)){
                col.Ind <- which(colnames(facts)==headers[i,1])
                colnames(facts)[col.Ind] <- headers[i,2]
        }
        return(facts)
}

facts2 <- new.headers(headers,facts)
kable(head(facts2))%>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))

```



## Merging the demographic data and the primary election results data. 

We determine what keys will foster the optimal join. Before merging the data sets, we prepare them by matching data types of columns.

### Prepare data sets for merging

```{r join demographic and primary election result data}

facts2$county <- sapply(facts2$area_name , function(x) {
  str_replace_all(x, " County" , "")
})

typeof(facts2$county) #Data type of county in facts2
typeof(new_pr_df$county) #Data type of county in new_pr_df
new_pr_df$county <- as.character(new_pr_df$county) # Convert county in new_pr_df to character

typeof(facts2$state_abbreviation) #Data type of the state abbreviation in facts2
typeof(new_pr_df$state_abbr)  #Data type of the state abbreviation in new_pr_df

facts2$state_abbreviation <- as.character(facts2$state_abbreviation) # Convert county in new_pr_df to character
new_pr_df$state_abbr <- as.character(new_pr_df$state_abbr) # Convert county in new_pr_df to character

#Trim white space around character data
facts2$state_abbreviation <- trimws(facts2$state_abbreviation)
new_pr_df$state_abbr <- trimws(new_pr_df$state_abbr)
facts2$county <- trimws(facts2$county)
new_pr_df$county <- trimws(new_pr_df$county)
```

### Left join by county and state

```{r}
#Left join by count and state abbreviation
complete_data <- left_join(new_pr_df, facts2, by = c("county", "state_abbr" = "state_abbreviation" ))
```

#### Dimensions of merged data and original data

```{r}
dim(new_pr_df) # Dimension of primary election data
dim(facts2) # Dimensions of the demographic data, which is organized on the county level. 
dim(complete_data) # Dimensions of the two datasets merged by an inner join, which is a left join that creates a dataset that only contains exact matches across the two data frame.
unique(complete_data$state_abbr) # Listed here are the states that were accurately joined. 
```

#### Where did the two data frames not match (i.e. the rows with NA values)

```{r}
anyNA(complete_data) #There are missing values

#Create a subset of the merged data that only contains those rows where there are NA values.
df_did_not_match <- subset(complete_data, is.na(complete_data$area_name))
dim(df_did_not_match) #There are 1491 rows where the primary election data did not match the demographic data

df_did_not_match$fips_length <- sapply(df_did_not_match$fips.x, nchar)
unique(df_did_not_match$fips_length) #In the df_did_not_match subset, there are FIPS code 4, 5, and 8 digits in length. 

count((subset(df_did_not_match, fips_length==4))) #Number of fips codes that are 4 digits long
count((subset(df_did_not_match, fips_length==5))) #Number of fips codes that are 5 digits long
count((subset(df_did_not_match, fips_length==8))) #Number of fips codes that are 8 digits long

unique(df_did_not_match$state) #States that did not properly match. 
```


### Left join by fips code

As shown below, this merge leads to better results. Rather than 1491 rows not matching as was the case when joining by the state and county, using the FIPS code as join by key leads to 1419 rows to not match. On top of this, when joining by the FIPS code a mere 11 states' primary election results do not accurately match.

```{r}
complete_data <- left_join(new_pr_df, facts2, by = c("fips"))
```

#### Dimensions of merged data and original data

```{r}
dim(new_pr_df) # Dimension of primary election data
dim(facts2) # Dimensions of the demographic data, which is organized on the county level. 
dim(complete_data) # Dimensions of the two datasets merged by an inner join, which is a left join that creates a dataset that only contains exact matches across the two data frame.
unique(complete_data$state_abbr) # Listed here are the states that were accurately joined. 
```

#### Where did the two data frames not match (i.e. the rows with NA values)?

```{r}
anyNA(complete_data) #There are missing values
```

We create a subset of the merged data that only contains those rows where there are NA values.

```{r}
df_did_not_match <- subset(complete_data, is.na(complete_data$area_name))
dim(df_did_not_match) #There are 1419 rows where the primary election data did not match the demographic data. This is compared to the 1491 rows that did not match when using state and county names. 

df_did_not_match$fips_length <- sapply(df_did_not_match$fips, nchar)
unique(df_did_not_match$fips_length) #In the df_did_not_match subset, are only FIPS code 8 digits in length and observations without a FIPS code.

count((subset(df_did_not_match, fips_length==4))) #Number of fips codes that are 4 digits long
count((subset(df_did_not_match, fips_length==5))) #Number of fips codes that are 5 digits long
count((subset(df_did_not_match, fips_length==8))) #Number of fips codes that are 8 digits long

unique(df_did_not_match$state) 
```

## Data limitations 

The election data (new_pr_df) is organized on the basis of towns and cities for many states, while the demographic data we are using is solely organized on the basis of counties. The FIPS code only refers to counties, so for those states that are not organized by county, they have a code in the FIPS code column that is not actually a FIPS code. 

Take the case of Connecticut (CT), for instance. Connecticut has a mere 8 counties in reality. However, in the primary election data, new_pr_df, there are 169 observations. In the column labeled county for the state of Connecticut, the names listed do not refer to county names; rather, they refer to town and city names. While each of these towns and cities are in a county and can be assigned to a county, neither the new_pr_df or the facts2 data frames contain the necessary information to do this.

For the analysis we would like to conduct, these 11 states that are not organized on a county basis can be ignored. Moving forward, we will use the data below. 


## Data analysis

For the analysis of this data, we use the following data frame, created by an inner join by FIPS codes.

```{r}
complete_data <- inner_join(new_pr_df, facts2, by = c("fips"))
dim(complete_data) # 2798 counties
unique(complete_data$state) #40 states 
write.csv(complete_data, "complete_data.csv")

trump_data <- complete_data %>% filter(`trump votes`> 0)  
write.csv(trump_data, "trump_data.csv")

```


### Analysis on votes gained by Trump and Clinton 

Let's do a Backward elimination process to find the relationship of demographic metrics on Votes gained by Trump and Clinton.  Backward elimination is the process of removing the metrics which are less statisically significant to a particular target metric. The idea here is that the metrics having less p-value (significance) has high co-relation to the target metrics. Once this is done, we will look at those metrics which are having less p-value (high significance).

First, we will do it for Trump. 

- Target metric : Votes gained by Trump 

- Metrics used : Since there are lot of demographic metrics in the data set, we will use some possible metrics by doing conscious judgment. 

        + Persons under 5 years, percent, 2014
        + Persons under 18 years, percent, 2014
        + Persons 65 years and over, percent, 2014
        + Female persons, percent, 2014
        + White alone, percent, 2014
        + Black or African American alone, percent, 2014
        + American Indian and Alaska Native alone, percent, 2014
        + Asian alone, percent, 2014
        + Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, percent, 2014
        + Two or More Races, percent, 2014
        + Hispanic or Latino, percent, 2014
        + White alone, not Hispanic or Latino, percent, 2014
        + Households, 2009-2013
        + Per capita money income in past 12 months (2013 dollars), 2009-2013
        + Retail sales per capita, 2007

### Relationship between Households with Trump, Clinton votes gained

Based on the above results, we see the metrics "Households, 2009-2013" has a high significance level on votes gained regardless of candidates. In fact, there are a couple of other metrics too [Per capita money income, Retail sales per capita, 2007] which are common to both candidates, but highly significant to the target metric. 

Let's create a scatterplot for trump favored states [Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania counties] that shows mean household and total votes gained for Trump/Clinton for each states. We see a linear relationship between Households and votes gained [Trump]. But slope of line is different in both cases. Clinton has higher slope than Trump which means that counties having low household is favoring Trump and counties having high household favoring Clinton.

Please read this article which commends on "Richer people vote more":
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/low-voter-turnout-increasing-household-income-may-help/

![States where Trump won.](https://i.imgur.com/jZdqWUs.png)

Now let's create a scatterplot for Clinton favored states [California, New York, New Jersey counties] that shows mean household and total votes gained for Trump/Clinton for each states. Here as well, we get a linear relation, but slope is more or less same which means there is not much favorism towards Trump in these states.

### More analysis

#### Number and percentage of votes

First let's take a look at how close the election was - let's look at the average percentage and number of votes for all 4 candidates. 

```{r}
perc_votes<-complete_data %>%
  select ("sanders fraction votes", "clinton fraction votes", "trump fraction votes", "cruz fraction votes")
count_votes<-complete_data %>%
  select ("sanders votes", "clinton votes", "trump votes", "cruz votes")

# Average
sort(apply(perc_votes, 2, mean, na.rm=TRUE), decreasing = TRUE)
# Sum of votes
sort(apply(count_votes, 2, sum, na.rm=TRUE), decreasing = TRUE)
```

We can see that Clinton was in the lead by both average percentage and total count of votes in the states we have the data for. 

#### Votes of female population

Let's take a look at how gender correlates with the results by examining the relationship of female population with results for each candidate.

```{r}
#Democrats
plot(complete_data$"Female persons, percent, 2014", complete_data$`clinton fraction votes`, main = "Clinton Data", xlab = "% of female population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
plot(complete_data$"Female persons, percent, 2014", complete_data$`sanders fraction votes`, main = "Sanders Data", xlab = "% of female population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
#Republicans
plot(complete_data$"Female persons, percent, 2014", complete_data$`trump fraction votes`, main = "Trump Data", xlab = "% of female population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
plot(complete_data$"Female persons, percent, 2014", complete_data$`cruz fraction votes`, main = "Cruz Data", xlab = "% of female population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
```

It looks like the "Clinton" data shows a correlation - the counties with higher female population - seem to be showing higher Clinton votes in the primary election. There is also the opposite effect for Bernie Sanders. 

#### Votes of  white population

Let's take a look at how race correlates with the results by examining the relationship of white population with results for each candidate.

```{r}
#Democrats
plot(complete_data$"White alone, percent, 2014", complete_data$`clinton fraction votes`, main = "Clinton Data", xlab = "% of white population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
plot(complete_data$"White alone, percent, 2014", complete_data$`sanders fraction votes`, main = "Sanders Data", xlab = "% of white population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
#Republicans
plot(complete_data$"White alone, percent, 2014", complete_data$`trump fraction votes`, main = "Trump Data", xlab = "% of white population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
plot(complete_data$"White alone, percent, 2014", complete_data$`cruz fraction votes`, main = "Cruz Data", xlab = "% of white population", ylab = "Percentage of votes for Candidate")
```

From visual inspection it looks like "Sanders"  and "Trump" were slightly more popular in the counties with higher white only population.

#### Votes of foreign born population

Let's see if percentage of foreign born population impacts results.

```{r}
#Democrats
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Foreign born persons, percent, 2009-2013' >=15,]$'clinton fraction votes', complete_data$'clinton fraction votes', names = c("in counties with over 15% foreign born", "overall votes"), ylab = "Clinton")
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Foreign born persons, percent, 2009-2013' >=15,]$'sanders fraction votes', complete_data$'sanders fraction votes', names = c("in counties with over 15% foreign born", "overall votes"), ylab = "Sanders")
#Republicans
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Foreign born persons, percent, 2009-2013' >=15,]$'trump fraction votes', complete_data$'trump fraction votes', names = c("in counties with over 15% foreign born", "overall votes"), ylab = "Trump")
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Foreign born persons, percent, 2009-2013' >=15,]$'cruz fraction votes', complete_data$'cruz fraction votes', names = c("in counties with over 15% foreign born", "overall votes"), ylab = "Cruz")
```

It looks like Clinton and Trump were more popular in counties with a higher percentage of foreign born population but the differnce doesn't seem very drastic.  

#### Median household effect in votes 

Let's see if median household income impacts results. We compare overall results with results of households with median income over 80K. 

```{r}
#Democrats
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Median household income, 2009-2013' >=80000,]$'clinton fraction votes', complete_data$'clinton fraction votes', names = c("median income over 80K", "overall votes"), ylab = "Clinton")
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Median household income, 2009-2013' >=80000,]$'sanders fraction votes', complete_data$'clinton fraction votes', names = c("median income over 80K", "overall votes"), ylab = "Sanders")
#Republicans
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Median household income, 2009-2013' >=80000,]$'trump fraction votes', complete_data$'clinton fraction votes', names = c("median income over 80K", "overall votes"), ylab = "Trump")
boxplot(complete_data[complete_data$'Median household income, 2009-2013' >=80000,]$'cruz fraction votes', complete_data$'clinton fraction votes', names = c("median income over 80K", "overall votes"), ylab = "Cruz")
```

Clinton and Trump are very significantly favored by household with median income over 80K.
