```{r message=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
pr_df <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/che10vek/Data-607-Assignments/master/Primary_Results2016%20(1).csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(pr_df)
```
Spreading the dataset to move candidate votes and fraction data from rows to columns. The code was adapted from the following help page: https://community.rstudio.com/t/spread-with-multiple-value-columns/5378

```{r}
pr_df$party <- NULL
pr_df_wide <- pr_df %>%
    gather(variable, value, -(state:candidate)) %>%
    unite(temp, candidate, variable) %>%
    spread(temp, value)
head(pr_df_wide)
```

Now let's create a new dataframe with only the data for 3 candidates we are intersted in: Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump.

```{r}
new_pr_df <- data.frame(pr_df_wide$state, pr_df_wide$state_abbreviation, pr_df_wide$county, pr_df_wide$fips, pr_df_wide$`Bernie Sanders_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Bernie Sanders_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Hillary Clinton_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Hillary Clinton_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Donald Trump_fraction_votes`, pr_df_wide$`Donald Trump_votes`)
names(new_pr_df) <- c("state", "state_abbr", "county", "fips", "sanders fraction votes", "sanders votes", "clinton fraction votes", "clinton votes","trump fraction votes", "trump votes")
head(new_pr_df)
```
